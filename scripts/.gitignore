```    *   **Decision on `.env`:** Your current `.env` only contains UID/GID, which isn't strictly secret. However, it *is* environment-specific. Best practice is often to *ignore* `.env` and provide a template file like `.env.example` that *is* committed, instructing others how to create their `.env`. For now, you could commit it or ignore it. I'd lean towards ignoring it.
*   **Decision on `output_data/`:** If this folder will only ever contain data generated *by* the script when the DAG runs, you probably don't need to commit it. If it contains source files you manually place there, you *would* commit it.
